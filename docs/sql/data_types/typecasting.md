title: Typecasting

The term typecasting refers to the operation of converting a value from one data type to the corresponding value in another data type.
Like other SQL engines, DuckDB supports both [implicit](../expressions/cast#Implicit Casting) and [explicit typecasting](../expressions/cast#Explicit Casting).

The following matrix describes a conversions are possible.
When implicit casting is allowed, it implies that explicit casting is also possible.
