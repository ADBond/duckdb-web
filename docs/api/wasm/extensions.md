Default [extensions](../../extensions/overview) enabled in DuckDB-Wasm are HTTPFS and Parquet.

To add more extensions, you will have to build DuckDB-wasm by yourself.

Dynamic extension loading is currently experimental, partecipate in the [tracking issue](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm/issues/1202) or try it on the experimental deployment at: https://shellwip.duckdb.org.
