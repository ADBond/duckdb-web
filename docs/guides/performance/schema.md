## Types

It is important to use the correct type for encoding columns (e.g., `BIGINT`, `DATE`, `DATETIME`). While it is always possible to use string types (`VARCHAR`, etc.) to encode more specific values, this is not recommended as strings are generally slower to process.

When loading CSV files, you may leverage the CSV reader's [auto-detection mechanism](../../data/csv/auto_detection) to get the correct types for CSV inputs.

If you run in a memory-constrained environment, using smaller data types (e.g. `TINYINT`) can reduce the amount of memory and disk space required to complete a query. DuckDBâ€™s [bitpacking compression](/2022/10/28/lightweight-compression.html#bit-packing) means small values stored in larger data types will not take up larger sizes on disk, but they will take up more memory during processing.

_**Best Practice:**_ Use the most restrictive types possible when creating columns. Avoid using strings for encoding more specific data items.

### Microbenchmark: Using Timestamps

We illustrate the difference using the `creationDate` column of the [LDBC Comment table on scale factor 300](https://blobs.duckdb.org/data/ldbc-sf300-comments-creationDate.parquet). This table has approx. 554 million unordered timestamp values. We run a simple aggregation query that returns the average day-of-the month from the timestamps in two configurations.

First, we use a `DATETIME` to encode the values and run the query using the [`extract` datetime function](../../sql/functions/timestamp.md):

```sql
SELECT avg(extract('day' FROM creationDate)) FROM Comment;
```

Second, we use the `VARCHAR` type and use string operations:

```sql
SELECT avg(CAST(creationDate[9:10] AS INT)) FROM Comment;
```

The results of the microbenchmark are as follows:

<div class="narrow_table"></div>

| Column Type | Storage Size | Query Time |
|---|---|---|
| `DATETIME` | 3.3 GB | 0.904 s |
| `VARCHAR` | 5.2 GB | 3.919 s |

The results show that using the `DATETIME` value yields smaller storage sizes and faster processing.
