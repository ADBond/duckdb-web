We are excited to hold our first "DuckCon" DuckDB user group meeting outside of Europe in **San Francisco**. The meeting will take place in the afternoon of *June 29th*. The meeting will be held at the [San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)](https://www.sfmoma.org), in the Phyllis Wattis Theater.

In this edition, we (again) have a talk from DuckDB creators [Hannes Mühleisen](https://hannes.muehleisen.org/) and [Mark Raasveldt](https://mytherin.github.io/) about the current state of DuckDB and future plans. Side note: Hannes will also speaking at the [Data + AI Summit](https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit/) earlier that day.

### Registration Process
Attendance is free, but since we expect that more people will like to attend than we have space for, we will use a two-step registration process. Starting today, you can [**pre-register** in this form](https://forms.gle/g2T98rS4Y1rGYjCc7). Please do so until May 26th. Around June 1st, we will distribute a first round of tickets between people that have filled the form. You will need to show this ticket at the entrance to attend. Please contact [quack@duckdb.org](mailto:quack@duckdb.org) if you have any questions.

### MotherDuck Party at 111 Minna
**Following DuckCon**, MotherDuck will host a party celebrating ducks at 111 Minna (located very close to SFMOMA). DuckCon attendees are cordially invited to attend to eat, drink, and play games. MotherDuck's Chief Duck Herder will also demo the latest work bringing DuckDB to the cloud. Please note that you will have to [separately register for the MotherDuck event](https://bit.ly/motherduck-party).
